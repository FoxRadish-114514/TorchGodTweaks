Torch God Tweaks provides a way to skip the event entirely, and some QoL features regarding torches, Torch God and Torch God's Favor.

Torch God's Favor Recipe:
* Toggle if Torch God's Favor will be craftable. Recipe:
    * Gold/Platinum Bar, x4
    * Torch, x100
    * Ice, Jungle, Desert, Crimson/Corruption Torch, x25 each
    * Crafted at Demon Altar

Reverse Torch Swap:
* Toggle if biome torches should turn into regular torches when picked up (only if 'Biome torch swap' is enabled)
    * This does not include Coral, Cursed, and Ichor torches

Convert Torches Upon Hardmode:
* Toggle if any torch that is near evil blocks will get converted to the corresponding evil torch when hardmode is first entered

Prevent Torch God Spawn:
* Toggle if Torch God should never spawn (its regular condition is 'more than 100 torches nearby while underground')

Convert Torches When Clentaminating:
* Toggle if any placed, convertible torch (any evil or regular torch) will get converted when Clentaminator is used
* This will only convert to/from regular torches, not bone torches

Check the config for more details (all options are enabled by default).
